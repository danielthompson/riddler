### Riddler Classic
From David Seal, a classic construction problem perfect for Infrastructure Week:

Consider four towns arranged to form the corners of a square, where each side is 10 miles long. You own a road-building company. The state has offered you $28 million to construct a road system linking all four towns in some way, and it costs you $1 million to build one mile of road. Can you turn a profit if you take the job?

_Extra credit_: How does your business calculus change if there were five towns arranged as a pentagon? Six as a hexagon? Etc.?

## Answer:

By a kind of heuristic / guessing / iterative reduction method, I found that the shortest graph I could come up with that connects those four points looked like this:
